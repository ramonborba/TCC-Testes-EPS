	abstract = {Summary This paper presents four of the most employed nanosatellite's Electrical Power System (EPS) architectures, comparing their efficiency through simulations and experiments. Every circuit architecture has been mathematically modeled in order to discuss the solar panel control technique and the overall architecture efficiency. Solar panels and EPS components have been analytically modeled and tested in order to comprehend their impact on the EPS efficiency. A test stand has been proposed to evaluate the circuits, emulating the solar irradiance and the nanosatellite power consumption. The following electrical power systems have been designed, implemented, and tested: the directly coupled architecture, the very low dropout (VLDO) voltage regulator architecture, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) with an integrated circuit, and the MPPT architecture with a discrete boost regulator. A case study has been presented, testing all the EPS architectures according to the Floripa-Sat I (1U CubeSat) power consumption profile. Experiments results have shown that, although the MPPT boost regulator architecture harvest more energy, it is the VLDO architecture that presents the best overall efficiency.},

	abstract={CubeSats have been popular for space research due to lower cost, faster development, and easier deployment. The electrical power system (EPS) is one of the significant subsystems for the CubeSat since it handles power generation, energy storage, and power distribution to all other subsystems. Therefore, the design of EPS becomes crucial for successful CubeSat mission, wherein the first step is the selection of EPS architecture. The main objective of this article is to present an extensive review of all the conventional and emerging EPS architectures of CubeSats. A total of 17 categories of CubeSat EPS architectures have been identified, classified, and the operational aspects of these architectures are presented in addition to a qualitative comparison. This article is expected to provide a useful reference guide for all the researchers and developers working in the area of CubeSats EPS. Also, some of the potential research topics are provided to further exploration and innovation for the CubeSat EPS.},

	abstract={The FloripaSat-I project consists of an initiative from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), in Brazil, to train students to design, test and integrate innovative space systems. The group just developed its first open-source CubeSat, the FloripaSat-I, which aims to empower students to develop space systems through a practical approach, where they have full control of the design and test of a real spacecraft. The project has already gone through all the stages of a CubeSat mission prior to the launching and operation stages. A prototype of the satellite, as well the engineering models 1 and 2 (EM-I and EM-II) were built. The expertise provided by the engineering models allows the development of a functional flight model (FM). This paper presents the validation and qualification tests that pass various FloripaSat-I models, from the engineering model to the flight model. All stages of the project are described, the tests performed in each phase, as well as the lessons learned. Thus, this paper serves as a guidance for other university teams that want to test their own CubeSats, as well as teams that want to use the open-source hardware and software left as heritage by this project.},

	abstract={Earth orbiting satellites come in a wide range of shapes and sizes to meet a diverse variety of uses and applications. Large satellites with masses over 1000 kg support high-resolution remote sensing of the Earth, high bandwidth communications services, and world-class scientific studies but take lengthy developments and are costly to build and launch. The advent of commercially available, high-volume, and hence low-cost microelectronics has enabled a different approach through miniaturization. This results in physically far smaller satellites that dramatically reduce timescales and costs and that are able to provide operational and commercially viable services. This paper charts the evolution and rise of small satellites from being an early curiosity with limited utility through to the present where small satellites are a key element of modern space capabilities.},

The standard of CubeSats has boosted the development of nanosatellites by the end of the twentieth century and the total amount of projects has grown to about a hundred projects worldwide until August 2009. Pico- and nanosatellites can in general be distinguished from satellites with bigger mass ranges by their relatively short development time, low cost and usage of the latest technologies. To obtain a better understanding of the current technology level and applications of nanosatellites and to spot trends in the global development and growth of such projects, a survey is performed including almost all launched pico- and nanosatellites. A key finding is that most subsystem technologies used are rather advanced, except for the attitude control systems and performance characteristics of subsystems that depend on attitude control. Education and technology demonstration remain the most dominant mission objectives, although some scientific experiments have already been conducted.}

Using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, a Single Weibull and a 2-Weibull mixture parametric model are fitted to the non-parametric data. Furthermore, by combining developers’ beliefs on several reliability aspects from a survey conducted in late 2014 with data from past missions, we make a first attempt to correlate space engineering “best guesses” and intuition to actual data. Finally, the probabilistic CubeSat reliability estimation tool is introduced as a method to reduce the infant mortality of CubeSats: CubeSat developers should be able to estimate their required functional testing time on subsystem and system level at an early project stage, while targeting a desired reliability goal on their CubeSat.}
